                          <p class="date">May 2014</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of fifteen, I spent a week working at Pixels 2 Canvas, which is a small business that specialises in t-shirt and canvas printing. 
                              This was great work experience for me, as I was able to gain knowledge in Photoshop, an essential tool in the website design industry. 
                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of this time was spent editing photos and creating custom products for customers, as well as creating the shipping labels for said products. 
                              I was also able to create a website banner for a website, which sparked my interest in website design.</p>

                          <p class="title2">Caffè Corrò, Eastbourne - <i>Café Assistant / Waitress</i></p>
                          <p class="date">July 2015 - September 2017</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a café assistant, my main role was taking customer orders, including operating the till. I would also be preparing and serving various food and drink options to customers, as well as cleaning their table after the meal and making sure they had a comfortable experience. From this, I was able to learn how to interact with people in a professional, yet approachable way.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also gained the valuable skills of working as a team and performing well under the stressed conditions of busy periods. As well as customer service, I would carry out various independent daily tasks to keep the store running smoothly. This includes replacing stock and cleaning to prepare for the next day.</p>
